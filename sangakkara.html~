               <h2 class="section-heading">Overview</h2>

             <p> It goes without saying that Kumar Sangakkara is arguably one of the finest cricketers that modern day cricket has seen . The finesse in his batting cannot be matched by anyone . Coupled with a great cricketing brain , he is a sort of cricketer that any team would love to have in its ranks.</p>


                    
                <h2 class="section-heading">Early Life</h2>
          
                    
               <p>Having been able to don the national colours in badminton and tennis at an early age , Kumar's hunger for success was quite prominent . Cricket was no exception for him . A handy knock of 156 not out against a touring Zimbabwe A side helped him to secure a place in the Sri Lankan team . Since then there's been no looking back . He has made numerous records his own over the past two decades.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">His Cricketing Journey</h2>

                       

                    <p>Kumar Sangakkara has been described by many as to be one of the most polished batsmen in cricket . Technically sound and well gifted , he has numerous batting records across all formats of the game . He holds the record of being the top run scorer for Sri Lanka in ODIs and second overall , only behind Sachin Tendulkar . A more-than-able wicketkeeper , he holds the record for most dismissals in ODIs . In Tests , he is currently the fifth highest run getter of all time.</p>

                    <span class="caption text-muted"></span>

                    <p>If all these weren't enough to place his name alongside the all time greats , then surely his feats of being the fastest to 8000,9000,10000,11000,12000 Test runs are . He has been a regular member of the ICC Test and ODI Team of the Year , featuring six and three times respectively over the past decade . He has also pocketed the ICC Cricketer of the Year (2012) , ICC Test Cricketer of the Year (2012) & ICC ODI Cricketer of the Year (2011,2013) . He is one of the two cricketers to have won the Wisden Leading Cricketer of the Year (2011,2015).</p>




                   
                    

                    <h2 class="section-heading">High Point</h2>

                       
                    

<p>The high point of Sanga's career was winning the 2014 ICC T20 World Cup in Bangladesh . The disappointment of final losses in 4 consecutive major ICC Tournaments notwithstanding , Kumar Sangakkara led the island nation to its first major title since the 1996 World Cup win . His 'Man of the Match' performance of 52 unbeaten runs was an icing on the cake.</p>

<blockquote>MCC Spirit of Cricket Speech , 2011 : 

<p>In 2011 , Sangakkara became the only active cricketer and youngest person till date to deliver the MCC Spirit of Cricket Cowdrey Lecture at Lord's . The speech was widely praised in the cricketing community . His speech focused mainly on the problems stalling the growth of Sri Lankan cricket . It has also been widely regarded as "the most important speech in cricket history" .
</p>
</blockquote>
                    
                
<p>There can be little doubt that he is one of the most exceptional cricketers that the modern day game has seen . His retirement puts an end to arguably the finest generation of batsmen that cricket will ever see , notable among those being Sachin Tendulkar , Ricky Ponting , Mahela Jayawardene , Rahul Dravid and Brian Lara . His name will surely be mentioned among the echelons of cricketing greats for years to come.</p>
